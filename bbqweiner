unwrap weiner from plastic
hold vertically and insert into toaster, but dont let go
push the toaster control down so the bars come together gently gripping the weiner
let go the weiner
put some bbq sauce on a small plate
dont use a large plate unless your aim is bad
large plates take all the fun out of this
stand by the toaster with the prepped plate
wait
when done the weiner will come shooting up out of the toaster
catch it on the plate
enjoy
